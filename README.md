Original gtk theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=158721
Added XFWM4 theme from here: https://www.xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Windows+8+Greybird+Xfwm+Theme?content=167427

The original theme had a lot of warnings in gtk+ 3.22, so I just did some edits to minimize them.
I could work more on this to make it better, depending on the availability of time.
